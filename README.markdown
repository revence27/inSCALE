About inSCALE
=============
**inSCALE** is a Malaria Consortium project funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It is currently being implemented in Mozambique and Uganda with the support of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and University College London's Centre for International Health and Development.

Innovations at Scale for Community Access and Lasting Effects (inSCALE) seeks to increase coverage of integrated community case management (ICCM), which provides community based-care for diarrhoea, pneumonia and malaria. This is achieved through training community based agents to diagnose and treat these three main childhood illnesses. ICCM focuses on the widespread use of diagnostics for pneumonia and malaria, appropriate treatment and community health education.

inSCALE aims to demonstrate that coverage and impact of government-led ICCM programmes can be extended if innovative solutions can be found for critical limitations, such as motivation and retention of community health workers. Once feasible and acceptable solutions are identified, these solutions can be used to increase the coverage of ICCM and improve its quality
